# SWIM-Events
The SIIM Workflow Initiative in Medicine (SWIMâ„¢) is a Society for Imaging Informatics in Medicine sponsored initiative with initial goals of developing:

   a. common definition of the workflow steps within medical imaging departments;
    b. Key performance indicators that are defined using these workflow steps;
    c. Definitions of the data elements used to capture information about the workflow steps associated with these key performance indicators; and
    d. A prioritized plan for implementation.

Several SIIM corporate members (Agfa Healthcare, Carestream, GE Healthcare, Siemens, Toshiba) have been at the forefront, working together with SIIM, researchers and providers to develop the processes and dashboards to improve provider performance and enhance quality patient care.

SWIM efforts continue in order to streamline the language of medical imaging quality and analytics, drive beneficial change, address meaningful communications, and provide evidence-based documentation of value. This will result in the ability to compare imaging practices, improve efficiencies, and foster the development of best practices.

This repository will be the source for currently defined SWIM events for the various imaging sub-specialties as they become available.
